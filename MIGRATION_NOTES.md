# Migration Notes: Repository Modernization

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made during the repository modernization effort for SoulScript. The goal was to establish a solid foundation for development with modern tooling, automation, and best practices.

## Changes Made

### 1. Development Environment
- Added `.editorconfig` for consistent coding styles across editors
- Enhanced `.gitignore` with comprehensive patterns for Node.js/Next.js development
- Added `package-lock.json` for deterministic dependency resolution
- Set Node.js version requirement to `>=18.0.0` in `package.json`

### 2. Code Quality & Formatting
- Integrated ESLint with TypeScript and React plugins
- Added Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Configured recommended rules for TypeScript and React
- Added scripts for linting and formatting

### 3. Continuous Integration
- Set up GitHub Actions CI workflow with:
  - Node.js 20.x
  - Caching for faster builds
  - Type checking and linting
  - Build verification
- Added GitHub Pages deployment workflow

### 4. Documentation
- Created comprehensive `DIAGNOSIS.md` with project analysis and recommendations
- Updated `README.md` with modern project information
- Added this `MIGRATION_NOTES.md`

### 5. Security
- Added `.github/dependabot.yml` for automated dependency updates
- Implemented security best practices in CI workflows
- Pinned dependency versions for reproducibility

## Required Actions

### For Developers
1. Install the latest LTS version of Node.js (>=18.0.0)
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Use `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Use `npm run lint` to check for linting issues
5. Use `npm run format` to format code

### For CI/CD
1. Ensure the following GitHub Secrets are set in your repository:
   - `MONGODB_URI`: Connection string for MongoDB (for production builds)
   - `NPM_TOKEN`: NPM token (if using private packages)

## Breaking Changes
- None. This update is purely additive and doesn't modify any application code.

## Known Issues
- Test suite needs to be implemented (marked as TODO in CI workflow)
- Some dependencies have security vulnerabilities that should be addressed in a future update

## Future Improvements
1. Implement comprehensive test coverage
2. Set up automated dependency updates
3. Add end-to-end testing
4. Implement monitoring and error tracking
5. Set up performance benchmarking
